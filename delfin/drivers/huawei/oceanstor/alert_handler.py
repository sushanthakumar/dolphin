    Alert model contains below fields
    category : Type of the reported notification
    occur_time : Time of occurrence of alert. When trap does not contain it,
                 it will be filled with receive time
    match_key : This info uniquely identifies the fault point. Several infos
                such as source system id, location, alarm id together can be
                used to construct this
    me_dn : Unique id at resource module (management system) side. me stands
            for management element here
    me_name : Unique name at resource module (management system) side
    native_me_dn : Unique id of the device at source system that reports the
                   alarm
    location : Alarm location information. It helps to locate the lowest unit
               where fault is originated(Name-value pairs)
               ex: Location = subtrack, No = 1, Slot No = 5.
                   shelf Id = 1, board type = ADSL
    event_type : Basic classification of the alarm. Probable values such as
                 status, configuration, topology ....
    alarm_id : Identification of alarm
    alarm_name : Name of the alarm, might need translation from alarm id
    severity : Severity of alarm. Helps admin to decide on action to be taken
               Probable values: Critical, Major, Minor, Warning, Info
    device_alert_sn : Sequence number of alert generated. This will be helpful
                      during alert clearing process
    manufacturer : Vendor of the device
    Product_name : Name of the product
    probable_cause : Probable reason for alert generation
    clear_type : Alarm clearance type such as manual, automatic, reset clear
    me_category : Resource category of the device generating the alarm
                  Probable value: Network,Server,Storage..
